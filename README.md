# Visit Oromia App  with Admin panel
Visit Oromia App is a complete travel guide app based on a country that is completely developed on Googleâ€™s Flutter. It has also an admin panel which is also developed on Flutter Web. It works on both android & iOS. We have used Firestore Database as backend and Provider for state management and applied lots of animations to make this user-friendly. We have used Google maps and Its APIs to get nearby data like hotels and restaurants and show routes between the source and destination. It contains 50+ screens and clean & structured code samples.
